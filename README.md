## General Information
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

The data set contains the following diseases:

Actinic keratosis
Basal cell carcinoma
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented benign keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis
Squamous cell carcinoma
Vascular lesion


## Conclusions
- Here I have created different CNN models and compared those models to find the outcomes from each model giving some differences in the layers and the dataset.



## Technologies Used
- library - numpy, pandas, warnings,  matplotlib, Tensorflow, Keras, OS
